Welcome to the TableSoccer repository!

## ❔ About

TableSoccer is a multiplayer, turn-based, dice and cards soccer game: it takes the game of Soccer but with an RPG approach.

## 🎯 Roadmap

This is a for-fun side project. There is no official roadmap, but I have an idea of what to do. Ish.
- [x] Establish a general layout
- [x] Create some basic game assets
- [ ] Get at least a first basic group of soccer players moving around
- [ ] Create a functioning game model 
- [ ] Fine tuning RNG, special abilities, card effects and so on...
- [ ] Add multiplayer capabilites
- [ ] Train an AI model to add vs-Computer playing mode
- [ ] ~~Profit~~ Have fun! 🎉

## 🕹️ Usage

Please, note that things might or might not be working, depending on where I'm sitting along the roadmap.
